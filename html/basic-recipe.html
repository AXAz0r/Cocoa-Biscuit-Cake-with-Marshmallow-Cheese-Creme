        <h1>Cocoa-Biscuit Cake with Marshmallow-Cheese Creme</h1>
        <h2>Ground:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>280g solid, dry biscuits violently dismembered.</li>
            <li>20g cocoa powder, dark as our souls.</li>
            <li>120g slowly and painfully molten butter.</li>
            <li>Force everything in a cake tin with a diameter of 26 cm and use a cup to press your victim tightly against it, leaving a border of maybe 1 cm that is also pressed against the sides.</li>
            <li>Put it in the fridge for 10 Minutes and take it out right before it freezes to death.</li>
            <li>Put it into the oven and torture your victim for 15 Minutes by 180Â°C.</li>
        </ol>
            
        <h2>Marshmallow-Cheese Creme:</h2>
        <ol start="7">
            <li>Put 120g Marshmallows in a bowl, add 160g Cream Cheese and put it without mixing into the microwave for 1 Minute by 600 Watts.</li>
            <li>Beat the mixture up with your whisk until it doesn't look like it originally did anymore (A creme).</li>
            <li>Add 120g Milk and continue mixing.</li>
            <li>Add a teaspoon of lemon juice and continue mixing for a couple of seconds.</li>
            <li>Now pour the liquified remains into the previously made cake ground so it fills the hole in its heart.</li>
            <li>Put everything in the fridge for another hour.</li>
            <li>Eat it.</li>
            <li>Clean your mess up so you can make another one.</li>
        </ol>
